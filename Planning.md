# Planning of SceneForge AI

## Current Ideas and Issues

### Issue: Creating a new object under another newly created object

Objects use the Scene path of the parent object to create a new object in the scene.
We should use UIDs instead, for consistency and to avoid issues with object creation.
Problem is, that newly created objects do not have a UID yet.
Fix: Newly created objects need a UID, which could be generated by the AI and returned in the response.

### Idea: Error iteration

When the AI's response contains an error, while applying the changes, the AI should be able to iterate over the error and fix it.
Settings panel with max iterations and a button to retry the last response manually.

### Idea: Diff viewer

The user should be able to see the diff of the changes made by the AI.
It should look like the prefab diff viewer, already built into Unity.


### Idea: Settings panel

- Error iteration: Nax number of iterations to retry on error.
- Auto-apply changes: Automatically apply changes made by the AI without user confirmation.
- Allow object creation: Allow the AI to create new objects in the scene.
- Allow component creation: Allow the AI to create new components on existing objects.

## Prompt Structure

Prompts are structured in the following way:

```plaintext
User Instruction:
...

Scene Objects:
[
    {
        "uid": "unique_id",
        "name": "object_name",
        "path": "path in scene",
        "components": [
            {
                "type": "component_type",
                "properties": {
                    "property_name": "property_value"
                }
            },
            ...
        ]
    },
    ...
]

Additional Data (optional):
{
    "sprites": [
        {
            "name": "sprite_name",
            "path": "path in project"
        },
        ...
    ],
    "textures": [
        {
            "name": "texture_name",
            "path": "path in project"
        },
        ...
    ],
    "materials": [
        {
            "name": "material_name",
            "path": "path in project"
        },
        ...
    ],
    ...
}
```

### Additional Information

Prompts may include additional information important to the task.

- User Instruction (always): A description of the task to be performed.
- Scene Objects (always): A list of objects in the scene, each with a unique identifier, name, path, and components.
- Sprites (optional): A list of sprites in the Project folder, each with a name and path.
- Textures (optional): A list of textures in the Project folder, each with a name and path.
- Materials (optional): A list of materials in the Project folder, each with a name and path.
- Shaders (optional): A list of shaders in the Project folder, each with a name and path.
- Animations (optional): A list of animations in the Project folder, each with a name and path.
- Sounds (optional): A list of sounds in the Project folder, each with a name and path.
- Scripts (optional): A list of scripts in the Project folder, each with a name and path.
- Fonts (optional): A list of fonts in the Project folder, each with a name and path.


### Serialization of Unity Types

- Color: Serialized as an array of four floats, representing RGBA values. For example, a red color would be represented as `[1, 0, 0, 1]`.
- Vector2: Serialized as an array of two floats, representing X and Y coordinates. For example, a vector pointing to the right would be represented as `[1, 0]`.
- Vector3: Serialized as an array of three floats, representing X, Y, and Z coordinates. For example, a vector pointing to the right would be represented as `[1, 0, 0]`.
- Quaternion: Serialized using the euler angles format, represented as an array of three floats. For example, a rotation of 90 degrees around the Y-axis would be represented as `[0, 90, 0]`.
- Transform: Serialized as an object with position, rotation, and scale properties. For example, a transform with a position of (1, 2, 3), a rotation of (0, 90, 0), and a scale of (1, 1, 1) would be represented as:
```json
{
  "position": [1, 2, 3],
  "rotation": [0, 90, 0],
  "scale": [1, 1, 1]
}
```


### Serialization of Components

Components are serialized as objects with a type and properties as seen in the example below:
```json
{
  "type": "component_type",
  "properties": {
    "property_name": "property_value"
  }
}
```

#### Serialization of Common Components

- Transform: Serialized as an object with position, rotation, and scale properties.
- MeshRenderer: Serialized as an object with properties such as material, castShadows, and receiveShadows.
- MeshFilter: Serialized as an object with properties such as mesh.
- Collider: Serialized as an object with properties such as isTrigger, material, and bounds.

## Response Structure

Responses should be structured in the following way:

```plaintext
Some response text...

json
{
  "uid": {
    "Image": {
      "color": [1, 0, 0, 1]
    }
  }
}

Some more response text...
```

### Creating new Objects

Whenever the provided UID does not match any existing object, a new one will be automatically created.
The response must include the scene path of the new object's parent, which will be used to create the object in the scene.
All other components or properties will be applied in diff format to a newly created component with default values.
A Transform component will always be created for new objects, even if not specified in the response.

Example:
```json
{
  "new": {
    "parent": "Camera/NewObject",
    "Image": {
        "color": [1, 0, 0, 1]
    },
    "Transform": {
      "position": [10, 20, 30],
      "rotation": [0, 0, 0],
      "scale": [1.5, 2, 1]
    }
  }
}
```
